                <p>Assessing the safety and condition of your home’s wiring is essential for protecting your family and property. At Voltage Electricians, we proudly serve the Gallup New Mexico  area with comprehensive electrical services. Here are key indicators that your wiring may be outdated or unsafe.<br>One major sign is flickering lights, which often point to overloaded circuits or underlying wiring issues. If circuit breakers frequently trip, it may be time to evaluate your home’s electrical system. Additionally, warm outlets or a burning smell can indicate dangerous electrical problems that require immediate attention.<br>Older homes with two-prong outlets may also signify outdated wiring. Modern electrical systems use three-prong grounded outlets for better safety. If your home dates back to before the 1980s, you might have aluminum wiring, which is less reliable and can be a fire hazard.<br>Lastly, if your electrical system struggles to meet today’s demands—like running multiple devices at once—it may be time for an upgrade. Don’t risk safety in your home; reach out to Voltage Electricians for a professional inspection and advice in Gallup New Mexico . Our knowledgeable team is committed to ensuring your electrical system is up to standard and safe for your family.</p>
